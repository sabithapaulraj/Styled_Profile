      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Sabitha Paulraj. I'm a 3rd yr CS undergrad obsessed with ML and GenAI. You'll usually find me working with LLMs or deep-diving into NLP just for fun. If it's AI and it's cool — I dive into it.
        Lately, I've been getting into system design — learning how to architect large-scale systems, from LLDs to HLDs that actually scale.<br><br>
